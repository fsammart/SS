## Cell Index Method

#### How to run it?
```sh
-sf hola -o test -ir 0.1 -s CIM -M 10 -L 50 -N 100
```

sf means static file, for now its a dummy parameter, but it must be present.
In the future static topolgy will be read from there.

Particle radius is uniform and zero, but that will be modifiable in the future.
